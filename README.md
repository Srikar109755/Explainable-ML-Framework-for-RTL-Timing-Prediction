# Explainable-ML-Framework-for-RTL-Timing-Prediction
An explainable machine learning framework to predict post-synthesis timing slack (WNS) directly from RTL Verilog designs. Uses static RTL feature extraction, Random Forest regression, and SHAP explainability to provide early, interpretable timing insights.
